DrupalGPlusFeed
===============

A Google+ public feed module for Drupal 7.

This is a pretty simple, tiny little module, which uses the G+ API v1 to retrieve a user's public stream. You'll need a [G+ API key](https://developers.google.com/+/api/ "Google+ API"), and to know your G+ User ID. To find this, go [here](https://plus.google.com/me), and extract the long number between plus.google.com/ and /posts.

It presents itself as a very basic, table-organised list of the user's latest posts, with a each post linking back to its origin on G+. Check it out in action in the right-hand sidebar on [my tech blog](http://n00bsys0p.co.uk/blog).
